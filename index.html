        a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I am currently
        pursuing a double major in Computer Sciences and Mathematics. I also
        actively work on side projects which I post to GitHub, and I have
        included them here on this website under the Projects link. I have also
        attached links with which you can get in touch with me.
